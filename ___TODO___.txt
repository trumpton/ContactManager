1. Windows app locks up on contact open.
   Looks to be something in:
       mainwindow.ui, mainwindow.cpp, mainwindow_contactdetails.cpp

   What changed recently was that phone and groups were modified in the
   dialog, the taborder was updated, and also encryption was included.  
   It could also be the compiler configuration (and the code is actually fine).
