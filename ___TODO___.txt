1. Windows app locks up on contact open.
   Looks to be something in:
       mainwindow.ui, mainwindow.cpp, mainwindow_contactdetails.cpp

   What changed recently was that phone and groups were modified in the
   dialog, the taborder was updated, and also encryption was included.  
   It could also be the compiler configuration (and the code is actually fine).
   
   This has been identified as a bug in QT: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-43482
   Workaround is to ensure that the QTabDialog is not the last in the tablist of controls.
