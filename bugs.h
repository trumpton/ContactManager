  BUGS

1. With Google as the master
   Sync contacts, then reset sync counter and re-sync
   This downloads a second set of entries

   Status: Seems Fixed

2. Delete and purge on Google
   Then sync local changes
   Local entry still exists
   No complaints
   Nothing arrives on Google
   Doesn't matter which is master

3. Error reporting on sync not done

4. Clearing dialog after sync - buttons are ignored
